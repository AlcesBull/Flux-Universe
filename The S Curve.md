Popularized by Clayton Christensen in [The Innovator's Dilemma](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2615.The_Innovator_s_Dilemma), the S-curve is a phenomenon that shows up in many [[complex adaptive system]]s, not just the economy. Any process with positive feedback loops and growth ceilings will end up exhibiting sigmoid, or “S,” curves:

-   A rodent finds its way onto an island and the population explodes, though it slows down once it approaches the island’s [[carrying capacity]].
    
-   A fad starts when a celebrity wears a new type of sunglasses; it quickly expands until the entire subculture is wearing them.
    
-   A virus starts out in China and spreads until the whole world is infected (see: [[Pandemic]]). 
    
These examples share common stages. The optimistic and brimming-with-potential _gestation_ is followed by a period of rapid _growth_, a slowing era of _maturity_, and finally a steady _demise_. Though we may heroically try to bend this arc, wholly escaping the pattern is futile: a new S-curve is always emerging right as we begin our descent.

We can use this lens when examining a [[problem space]] as a team or an organization. 

- What stage of the S-curve are we currently in? 
- Is our hockey-stick growth going to continue forever? 
- What is the limiting factor (in other words, the ceiling of our S-curve)? 
- Might a new S-curve be emerging?

Recognizing the inexorability of the S-curve can give us a healthy degree of detachment. The sooner we accept that the shape of this curve is set, the more nimble we can be about finding the next one… although finding new S-curves is a bit of a miracle. Moving from gestation to growth isn’t guaranteed either; emergence is not a thing that can be manufactured. That’s what makes complex adaptive systems so much fun to work with.
