# Flux-Universe
An archival project to create a graph of notes based on the work of the [Flux Collective](https://read.fluxcollective.org).

Designed to be opened in Obsidian, which can be downloaded [here](https://obsidian.md/download) for Windows, macOS, and Linux.

Note for the time being, this project and its contents should be considered _extremely_ WIP until I catch up to the Flux Collective's episodic publishing.
