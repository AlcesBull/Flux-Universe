Notes on [Flux Review episode one](https://read.fluxcollective.org/p/01)

> “One had followed the rules, and one had not. But the problem with rules... was that they implied a right way and a wrong way to do things. When, in fact, most of the time they were simply ways, none of them quite wrong or quite right, and nothing to tell you for sure what side of the line you stood on.” — Celeste Ng
