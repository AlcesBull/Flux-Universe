##### [Efficiency is the Enemy](https://fs.blog/2021/05/slack/)
- Large organizational & cultural emphasis on "efficiency"
	- Particularly and specifically "time efficiency" meaning no waste of individual human time, rather than system efficiency in which the system reliably and timely produces intended results. The article distinguishes this as "effectiveness."
- **Total efficiency is a myth**
	- When we eliminate slack, we create a build up of work
	- Slack is culturally coded as "laziness" or lack of initiative
		- The problem is that without slack time we can't handle new tasks straight away or without an interruption cascade to the current workflow
		- This directly relates to [[Flow (Systematic)]] and the counterintutive principle of [[Induced Demand]]

	> üí° _‚ÄúIt‚Äôs possible to make an organization more efficient without making it better. That‚Äôs what happens when you drive out slack. It‚Äôs also possible to make an organization a little less efficient and improve it enormously. In order to do that, you need to reintroduce enough slack to allow the organization to breathe, reinvent itself, and make necessary change.‚Äù_

- **Having a little bit of wiggle room allows us to **respond to changing circumstances**, to experiment, and to do things that might not work.**
	- See also: [[Responsiveness (Systemic)]]
	- It is taxing to operate without Slack and creates [[scarcity]]
	- Having too much slack is a problem but [[Motivated individuals tend to take up slack]]
	- Slack allows us to handle the inevitable shocks and surprises of life
		- You'll need more than you expect
	- Occaisonally it is useful to forgo slack to [[reap the benefits of constraints]]
		- Can force inventiveness
		- Example: if you can't come up with an idea, give yourself five minutes to brainstorm (address the [[blank canvas effect]])
- **Slack and change**
	- Survival requires constant change and reinvention, and thus considerable slack
		- Slack allows us to think ahead, explore problems, avoid bad deals & danger, to make long term bets

- **Slack and productivity**
	- Counterintutively, we are more productive when we don't try to be productive constantly
	- Being comfortable with sometimes being 0% busy means we think about whether we're doing the right thing
		- Contrast to: grabbing the first task we see so no one thinks we're lazy

### Ideas

Consider a metric that watches how quickly a team takes up their slack so that they can replenish it in time.
