### What is it

[[Alex Komoroske]]'s publicly-available notes on systems, production, insight, etc. It is important to recognize that the source material available at [thecompendium.cards](https://thecompendium.cards/) will **always** be more up to date and complete than here in the Flux Universe. Many of the cards and ideas in the Compendium are represented here as linkages and nodes to the broader material of the Flux Universe, and they are included here in an attempt to contextualize them in a broader network of ideas than what Alex may run into as an individual.
