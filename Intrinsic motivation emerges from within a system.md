Intrinsic motivation is motivation that emerges from within the system of a given agent.

It's an amazing, renewable, self-sustaining resource. An ecosystem engine's momentum can be thought of as intrinsic motivation of the system (when viewed from the outside).

Intrinsic motivation is an emergent property which means even the system itself doesn't get to "choose" what direction it will take. Intrinsic motivation can be accelerated, but not enabled.

Although it might be indirectly affected by the external context, it is to some extent context-free. Since it's internal, you can't directly affect it from the outside. That means that you shouldn't try to create intrinsic motivation. Intrinsic motivation is sacred and extrinsic motivation is profane, so don't try to mix them.
