## Make it feel good.

Keep spare, comfortable harnesses. Use leather and wood. Don’t make people squint. Spices + honey. Keep the mess in the kitchen. Chop the lettuce. Have comfortable seats. Bring joy. Share joy.

## Create inspirational context.

Everything you make should be a platform for humanity to show up in the best way. Help people meet. Facilitate community. Keep people talking. Have caffeine and quality alcohol around. Be the most stoked person.

## Do the simplest thing that could possibly work.

Break the pitch up. Build one thing to solve one problem at a time. Be lossy. If you can’t be subtle about intent, be obvious about it. Do just enough. “Appropriate lessness.”

## Complexity via emergence.

Lots of small experiences done well lead to a great experience. Design a lot of things that work, then make them work together. Don’t build monoliths. Complicated usually doesn’t work and it never scales. Don’t make fragile plans. Solve one problem at a time.

## Don’t be fucking pretentious

Play music that will help everyone have a good time. Assume they haven’t read it. Don’t require people to understand references. Share perspective. Drop ideas not names. Don’t assume you know what people are thinking and why.

## and take a fucking position.

Hold strong opinions, weakly. Stand for something. If no one disagrees with you then you’re not actually doing anything. Thrive in the responsibility of making a choice.

## Make it easy.

Lay your gear out the night before. Talk through the route. The only people your product should be hard on is you while you’re building it. Make it easy to find. Cook vegan courses. Build wide doors and low tables. Use smaller words. Child’s mind.

## The client/user is never the problem.

You can’t change other people, you can only change yourself and the shit you build. Fix your house. Listen.

## Love the process.

What most people think of “design” is 1% of design. Slow is smooth, smooth is fast. Listen even if what you’re hearing hurts. Test more than you think you need to. Usually when things feel rushed it’s time to slow down. Bruise the body to refresh the soul. Remember the Warrior’s Way.

## Become talented.

If you need to know something to achieve greatness for your users, learn it. Become the best in the world at it. Make friends with people who are better than you. Learn from them. If you can’t make it well don’t punish your users by giving them something bad. Let talent be a decision lens. Take it off the plate. Go incredibly deep. “The truth is pointless when it is shallow.”
