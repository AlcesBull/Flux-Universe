# Things gain momentum as they roll down a gradient

##### [[The Compendium Cards]] | [LINK](https://thecompendium.cards/c/gain-momentum-roll-down-gradient)

Most things happen based on things rolling down a gradient. As things roll down a gradient, they pick up more and more momentum at an accelerating rate. This creates a naturally occurring compounding loop.

Even shallow gradients create large returns in the long-term, because there's long enough for the rolling to accumulate into large amounts of momentum. That's another way of saying that asymmetries don't need to be strong to have huge effects.
