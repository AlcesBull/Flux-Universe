##### [The 4 Fallacies of Artificial Intelligence](https://www.discovermagazine.com/technology/the-4-fallacies-of-artificial-intelligence)

- **The fallacy of incremental triumphalism - narrow intelligence is part of a continuum that leads to general intelligence**
	- Machines are good at programmable tasks, number crunching, problems of scale
	- This makes them seem incredibly effective at things we're not, or things we aspire to be good at
	- "It was like claiming that the first monkey that climbed a tree was making progress towards landing on the moon." But in reality, there are numerous unexpected obstacles along the way

- **The assumption that because we can make computers do some things that are hard for humans we'll be able to simulate general intelligence**
	- [[Moravec's Paradox]]: "It is comparatively easy to make computers exhibit adult level performance on intelligence tests or playing checkers, and difficult or impossible to give them the skills of a one-year-old when it comes to perception and mobility"

- **The fallacy of wishful mnemonics**
	- The tendency to label certainb programs and/or benchmarks after the human characteristic they feel it mimics
		- See: Stanford Question Answering Dataset
	- These things actually test a narrow set of skills but get advertised as indicating human or general intelligence capabilities

- **The assumption of intelligence being purely a feature of the brain**
	- See also: the [[the no-mind thesis]]
	- The idea that general/human intelligence can be abstracted away from the body is implicit in the brute force approach to AI development
	- Creating human-like motor behaviors in robots requires fundamentally different processing approaches than how these things work in people and animals (e.g. "muscle memory" and [[morphological computing]])

- **Human intelligence is an [[integrated system]]**
	- AI research and "success" might be based on a false sense of progress that comes from cherry-picking and optimizing parts, a type of [[System-Blindness]]
