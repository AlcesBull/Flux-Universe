##### [The Thermocline of Truth](https://robm.me.uk/2021/04/thermocline-of-truth/)

_In organisations, reality is not always what it seems. Why is it that often things look rosy right up until they fall apart?_

###### Royal Mail Story
1.  In the early 2000s, the newly privatised Royal Mail introduced a new IT system, called Horizon, aimed at reconciling every transaction made in every Post Office up and down the UK, removing the possibility for errors and fraud.
    
2.  Like all large-scale corporate IT projects, the system had a significant number of severe bugs, including some that resulted in duplicate transactions being logged – which meant that it appeared that cash was disappearing from some branches.
    
3.  Rather than believe that their flagship new IT system had crippling flaws, the top brass at the Royal Mail instead chose to believe that hundreds of their previously loyal sub-postmasters were embezzling cash.
    
4.  Royal Mail then spent nearly two decades pursuing those employees through the courts, bankrupting many and even sending some to prison, entirely on the basis of IT evidence and without any proof of wrongdoing.

The Royal Mail spent nearly two decades and over $100mm hounding loyal and entirely innocent employees through courts, ruining lives

	- Higher in the operational chain people have little first hand knowledge and rely on status reports, which when human-generated are subject to politicking, smoothing, and providing a "comically optimistic view of the state of projects"
		- [[People like to report good news]]
	- "As the project nears its supposed date of completion, though, it becomes harder and harder to hide the reality of just how screwed up the project is, and so the thermocline of truth moves upwards in the organisation. Eventually, the truth reaches the highest echelons of the organisation – be that days, weeks, or months before the deadline."
	- These are **not** the fault of subordinates, but actually reflect the [[culture]] set by leadership.
		- reputation > truth
		- rewards good news, punishes bad...shoots messengers (see: [[Pathological Organizations]] in the Westrum Typology)
		- Leaders aren't connected to the delivery of actual work (see: [[Leadership is not information-passing]])
	- "...surrounded by a senior management team desperate to protect their own reputations and that of the Royal Mail. They told her that there simply couldn’t be problems with the IT system on the scale that was being suggested; it was much more likely that the sub-postmasters were colluding, lying about IT bugs in order to escape responsibility for what was at best incompetence and at worst theft."
		- see: [[Theory X & Y]] and the assumption that the people, rather than the system, are in the wrong (toxic system blindness that violates humanism)
		- The new CEO was unwilling or unable to **create the conditions where the truth would emerge** (see: [[Leadership is an enabling function]])
		- Beware rosy pictures and confirmation bias. It is exceedingly difficult to tell when you're above the thermocline of truth
